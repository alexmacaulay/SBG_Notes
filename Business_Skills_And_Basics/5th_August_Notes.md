# 5th August - Information Security, Task Management & Presentation Skills

## Information Security

* Confidentiality - making sure something is secret is kept secret (encryption)
* Integrity - data you have is accurate and not be attacked and modified
* Availability - sites and games available

### What's at stake?

* Customer and employee personal information - ** Data Protection **
* Customer payment details (credit/debit card details) - ** PCI-DSS **
* The availability of our sites and games - ** DDoS **
* The integrity of our content - ** Secure coding, pen testing, bug bounty **
* Our reputation and brand
* Out intellectual property (IP)

### Data Protection

* Data protection act 1998 (DPA)
* Future is EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
* EU GDPR will come into effect by 25th May 2018
* As soon as we become aware of breech need to declare it
* Owned by compliance team at SB&G

### PCI-DSS

* SB&G are a ** Tier 1 merchant ** ( over 6 million transactions / year)
* Tier 1 = over 6 million transactions / year
* SB&G actually process over ** 50 million transactions / year **

### Security coding standards

* Secure coding initiative
* All new (devs) starters are sent on the secure coding training course that we run with Sec-1
* This is maintained with an additional half day refresher course annually
* Typically, devs attending the course believe they're already coding securely...  
But following the course we receive unanimously great feedback!

### Penetration testing

The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack
* "To catch a thief, you have t think like a thief"
* To stop a hacker...
* Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in systems
* Identify (and better understand) our real world exposure
  * Simulating an attack ensures that vulnerabilities or weaknesses aren't considered in isolation
* Verify out controls (defenses) work the way we expect them

### Bug bounty scheme

* SB&G have partnered with Hacker1 to form a bug bounty scheme
* This will be limited to SB&G employees (initially) then opened up
* This will allow researchers to notify SB&G of security weaknesses and in return receive rewards for engaging with us
* Rewards are real (cash) and range up to Â£1,500
* There is also a hall of fame

### Qualifications

* Offensive security certified
* OSCP
* OSCE
* Crest body qualifications
* Register tester
* Certified tester
* Simulated attack specialist  

## Task management

> "the process of managing a task during it's lifecycle, including **planning**, **tracking** and **reporting**"

**CAPTURE**  
**ORGANISE**  
**DO**

### CAPTURE

#### Where do tasks come from?

* Informal chat
* Social media (facebook, whatsapp, twitter, etc.)
* Email
* Phone / Text
* Slack
* Meetings
* Your brain

#### UBIQUITOUS CAPTURE

Capture stuff easily and have some way of capturing at all times

#### THE TWO MINUTE RULE

> "If it takes less than two minutes, then do it now."

#### Granularity of tasks

Find a new place to live - this isn't possible  
Find a new flat within 20 minutes of SB&G - more doable   
Call an estate agent - no real context  
Call Richmond Letting on 02033473456 - has context, can be done anywhere

**What's the next action?**

### ORGANISE

#### What affects a task's priority?

* Due date
* Size of task
* Importance
* Urgency

> "What is important is seldom is urgent and what is urgent is seldom important" - Dwight D. Eisenhower

** EISENHOWER MODEL **

![The eisenhower model](http://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/eisenhower-box.jpg)

1. = URGENT + IMPORTANT - Necessity
2. = NOT URGENT + IMPORTANT - Quality
3. = URGENT + NOT IMPORTANT - Deception
4. = NOT URGENT + NOT IMPORTANT - Waste

#### The Pareto Principle

* 80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients
* 80% of problems can be attributed to 20% of causes
* Fixing the top 20% reported bugs fixed 80% of errors and crashes
* 20% of the code has 80% of the errors

** What 20% of your work will provide 80% of the results? **

#### Managing tasks

* Calendar
* Outlook
* Wunderlist
* OneNote

#### Weekly reviews

* Clear inbox
* Go through voicemails
* Go through chats
* Look at tasks still to do
* Look through notes

### DO

** STOP MULTITASKING. IT KILLS YOUR FOCUS. **
