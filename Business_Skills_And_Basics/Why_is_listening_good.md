# Why is good listening important?

* Get to hear the full story - sometimes when if you interrupt or start to formulate an answer before they have finished talking you will often not hear anything
* Makes the person feel valued
* Makes the person more likely to open up to you/be more helpful in conversations in the future
* Helps you understand the topic/problem/conversation better and therefore will be able to formulate a better response
* Sometimes all someone needs is someone to listen, not to try and fix things or offer a solution, but just to listen

## Managers I have had and their listening skills

I think as a whole all the managers I have had have possessed good listening skills.

They never seemed to cut me off, they always took a second after I had finished speaking to take everything in and formulate a good response and they always acknowledged what I was saying to them, whether verbally or non-verbally.

## Summary

I think it takes time and practice to become a good listener but something that I think is a key skill to have, not only in business, but in life in general.
Some of the basics of good listening I think most people posses: good eye contact, verbal or non-verbal gestures and good body language.
I think a lot of people struggle with the parts that maybe they don't even realise they are doing?
Interrupting, formulating a response whilst the person is mid way through talking, showing poor body language, letting the mind wander.

These are the skills that need working on. Sometimes the mind has other, outside factors that it is worried about that could then affect how good one is at listening.
I've had it before (and i'm sure many people have) where something outside of work has happened and that is all that I can think about, no matter how hard I try.
There are means and ways of getting around this though and should be thought about and practiced as well, some of the main ones are meditating, clearing your mind completely and taking to someone about what is on your mind - let them be the good listener!
