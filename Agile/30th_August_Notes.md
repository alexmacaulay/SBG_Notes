# Agile and user stories

## Why Agile?

* Increase productivity
* Faster to market
* Flexibility

## Agile Manifesto

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Agile Principles

1. Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through **early** and **continuous** delivery of **valuable** software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes **harness change** for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. **Deliver** working software **frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work **together daily** throughout the project.

5. Build projects around **motivated individuals.** Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. 	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face** conversation.

7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote **sustainable** development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a **constant pace** indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical **excellence** and **good design** enhances agility.

10. **Simplicity**--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing** teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team **reflects** on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Task - write 6 user stories

I want a website for the local parachuting school, which I run. We're based on a small island in the Netherlands and a lot of the locals are into parachuting.

Firstly, I'd like people to know what the weather's like: wind speed and stuff like that. We get quite a few people drive over to us and then find the cloud is too low to jump.

Secondly, I'd like a place to sell and hire kit online. Parachutes, harnesses, lessons and all that. We also sell T-shirts and other memorobilia. It's got to look nice and load really quickly.

Thirdly, I'd like to show upcoming events, sales, competitions and open days; as well as the different sorts of lessons we offer.

8. As an english speaking user

9. As a user  
I want to be able to see the upcoming events

So that I can use it on the move.

11. As an owner

I want my payments to be secure  
So that I do not lose any money.

13. As an owner

So that users don't ever leave.

14. As an owner  
I want the system to be able to handle a lot of users  
So that the site is always available to the locals.
