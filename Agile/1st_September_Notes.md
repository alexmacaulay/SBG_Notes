# Scrum Recap and Extreme Programming

## Scrum Recap

### Scrum Roles

* Stakeholder
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Team Members

### Artifcacts

* Task Board
* Burn Down Chart
* Burn Up Chart
* Product Backlog
* Definition of Done
* User Stories
* Sprint Backlog


### Task Board

* Product backlog shouldn't be on the task board - too large
* Should have tasks - in swimlanes
* Keep it updated


## Extreme Programming (XP)

### XP Activities 

* Coding 
* Testing
* Listening
* Designing


### XP Values

* Communication
* Simplicity
* Feedback
* Courage
* Respect


### Core Practices of XP

* Encourage good deedback
* Continuous delivery
* Shared understanding
* Developer Welfare
* Code reviews


#### Encouraging good feedback

* Unit tests
* Automated styleguides
* Automated acceptance tests
* Pair programming
* Regular communication between developers
* Communication with the customer


#### Continuous delivery 

* Version control
* Automated build process
* Small releases 
* Deliver to production
* Automated deployments


#### Shared understanding

* Shared ownership of code
* Good code comments
* Coding standard
* Collaboration
* Code for otehrs to read
* System metaphor

#### Developer welfare

* Sustainable pace
* Keep it fun

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

![TDD - red, green, refactor](http://hanwax.github.io/assets/tdd_flow.png)

### Benefits 

* Improves quality by focusing on requirements before coding 
* Keeps code clearer, simpler and testable
* Provides documentation for other/new team members
* Provides repeatable tests for reression
* Enables rapic changes

## Pair Programming

* Lower defects, helps deliver faster and produce higher quality work
* Involves a driver and a navigator
* Works best if both people are peers, sharing the same role and having a similar skill and experience level
* Ensures that more than just one developer knows each part of the system

## Agile Presentations

* Next Tuesday
* split into groups
* Aim is
	* to demonstrate solid understanding of one or more areas of Agile/XP
	* to demonstrate the ability to conduct independent research
	* to demonstrate the ability to present technical information
* 15 minutes long
* powerpoint
* must expand on what has been taught
* must be interesting
* everyone must learn something new
* Areas:
	* an area of extreme programming
	* lean startup thinking
	* more advanced kanban
	* lean UX
	* impact mapping
	* story mapping
	* things to do in retros
	* agile at scale
	* domain driven design
	* something else interesting...
* deliverables
	* powerpoint deck
	* presentation

## Continuous Delivery

### Continuous Integration

* Integrate with the working system so far
* Run automated tests on every push
* Have a visible indicator of when the build is broken

### Continuous Delivery

* Uses CI to integrate into a prouction-like system
* Tests act as 'gates'

### Continuous Deployment

* Deploys all the way to production
* Build pipelines are often complex

### Pre-requisites for CI

* Version Control
* An automated build


## Retrospectives

* 1-2 hours
* Discuss the process
* Work out what went well?
* What didn't go so well?
* What could be improved?
* The goal
	* Identify a few specific things to improve and create an action plan for how to implement them

### The Agenda

* Set the stage
* Gather data
* Generate insights
* Decide what to do
* Close the retro

### The 5 whys

* _Why?_ The battery is dead.
* _Why?_ The alternator isn't working.
* _Why?_ The alternator belt has broken.
* _Why?_ The belt was beyond it's useful life and wasn't replaced.
* _Why?_ The car isn't serviced on the right schedule.

### Standup

* Talk about what was specificially 

## Tangible Actions

* Task Board
	* Start a sprint with the task board in a more accessible area
	* Copy user stories so engineers can have these right next to them as they work
	* Keep task board updated with who is working on what - add this to acceptance criteria
	* Break user stories into tasks/sub tasks
* Time Management
	* Have a meeting before grabbing the product owner
	* Make sure we are asking intelligent questions
	* Bounce the questions off one another first
	* Plan ahead - look at user stories that may be pulled in/coming up next
	* Produce a burn-chart to see current and projected velocity and if we are on track
* Challenge
	* Challenge each other as the product owner would
	* Challenge the product owner where necessary
* Additional Resources
	* More lego to ensure the whole city was fully built (not torn down after approval)
* Roles
	* STOP having a bad understanding of roles
	* When pair building have one to find the lego and other to build the lego (switch over after set time boxed period)
	* Adapt in roles and adjust roles
	* Assign a designer to a builder - work in pairs
* Other
	* Follow functional requirements - don't expand with unnecessary development
