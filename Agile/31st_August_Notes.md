## Scrum Artifacts 

* Product Backlog
	* In the simplest definition the Scrum Product Backlog is simply a list of all things that needs to be done within the project.
* Sprint Backlog 
	* The sprint backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the Scrum sprint. 
* Task Board
	* In Scrum the task board is a visual display of the progress of the Scrum team during a sprint. It presents a snapshot of the current sprint backlog allowing everyone to see which tasks remain to be started, which are in progress and which are done.
* Burn Down Chart
	* A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time.
* Burn Up Chart
	* A burn up chart shows how much work has been completed, and the total amount of work.
* Definition of Done
	* The team agrees on, and displays prominently somewhere in the team room, a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment "often a user story" is considered "done". 
* Definition of Done Examples
	1. Code produced (all ‘to do’ items in code completed)
	2. Code commented, checked in and run against current version in source control
	3. Peer reviewed (or produced with pair programming) and meeting development standards
	4. Builds without errors
	5. Unit tests written and passing
	6. Deployed to system test environment and passed system tests
	7. Passed UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and signed off as meeting requirements
	8. Relevant documentation/diagrams produced and/or updated
	9. Remaining hours for task set to zero and task closed
	10. Should load in 3 seconds
	11. Done in different speaking languages
	12. Passed Accessibility Testing

## Scrum Process

### Sprint Planning - What is it...

* Product Owner presents prioritized stories
* Split large Stories	
* Throw out stories not needed
* Discuss Acceptance Criteria 
* Discuss approach
* Add Acceptance Crieria
* Estimate stories
* Commite to the stories

### Sprint Planning - How we do it...

* Discuss implementation in detail
* Split the stories iinto tasks
* Adjust the commitment if needed
* Agree the sprint

### Adaptive Planning

### Daily Standup

* Daily
* Only the team are present

### Sprint Review

* Demonstrate the work done 
* No powerpoint - working software!
* Anyone can attend 
* A chance to demonstrate the team's achievements 
* Gather feedback from stakeholders 
* Get signoff on what's been done 
* Provide recommendations to stakeholders 


### Sprint Retrospective 

* Discuss the process
* Work out what went well?
* What didn't go so well?
* What could be improved?

> "We understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available and the situation at hand"

### Supporting Practices 

* Story Mapping
* Paper Prototyping 
* The Project Charter 
* Refactoring 
* TDD & BDD
* Pair Programming 
* Impact Mapping 

### Story Points

### Planning Poker 

* Encourages all team members to contribute to estimation 
* Involves the entire team - the people actually carrying out the work 
* Uses the wisdom of the crowd 
* Brings multiple diverse opinions together 
* Numbers on the cards are based on the Fibonacci sequence
